          For organ and brass is comprised of two works by the Stockholm-based composer Ellen Arkbro. Both works focus on tuning, intonation and harmonic modulation. In previous projects, Arkbro composed for early music ensembles, wrote a series of durational pieces utilising synthetic tones and processed guitars, and, most recently, presented a work lasting 26 days at the Stockholm Concert Hall. for organ and brass looks back to Arkbro’s studies in Just Intonation with La Monte Young, Marian Zazeela, and their disciple Jung Hee Choi in New York, as well as with kindred spirit Marc Sabat in Berlin.

          The title composition was written for an organ with a specific kind of historical tuning known as meantone temperament. It was only after locating an appropriate instrument—-the Sherer-Orgel dating back to 1624 in St. Stephen’s Church in Tangermünde, Northeastern Germany—-that Arkbro set about recording both for organ and brass and its counterpart, three.

        Björk’s new solo album is her 10th, and the round number is apt for a moment in which she’s taking stock of where she has come from and what she’s accomplished. Her new podcast, Sonic Symbolism, revisits the creation of each of her albums. Fossora addresses legacy and ancestry in a different way, with some of her most vivid songwriting and most daring arrangements to date. As velveteen-sounding woodwinds respire amid hard beats, Björk examines her place in a lineage of nurturers, peacemakers, and problem solvers. In our four hours together, she described the workings of “matriarch music”—a term that defines both Björk’s ethos and a broader, now-strengthening current in pop culture.

        Because she has also written a lot for film and television, it’s related to classic structure of film dramaturgy, or instructional books about how to write film and television. Our dance work is more related to Monty Python than to conceptual dance, which is kind of the world that we work in. We go through the elements that we claim that a dance performance is made up of, which at this point is that you need props, then there is an idea, and then we go through how you can get an idea. Then there is “location,” and we go through various types of locations. Then there is “situation,” what a situation is and what makes up a situation.We have also have intermission, and the intermission is kind of a hypnotizing moment where you imagine what the intermission is like.

        Then it goes into “subtext,” the idea of saying something else than what you mean. Actually, there’s a Wikipedia entry on “subtext,” and the example it gives is someone talking about the ocean when, in reality, that person only wants to have sex. Once you just say that sentence, then you can say almost anything about the ocean afterwards and everything becomes loaded. It also says this weird thing—that if subtext is done well, it’s almost as if there’s no subtext at all. That kind of makes sense, but it also doesn’t really. What does it even mean to do subtext so well that subtext disappears? What you’re saying in reality, then, really has no subtext; it’s completely flat.

      <p> 
        But I like the idea that anything you say it means something else. That’s also related to this idea of Monty Python, this idea of misunderstanding sexual innuendo. Then the next part, after “Subtext,” … what happens after “Subtext”? I’ve forgotten. There’s a lot of singing and dancing.
